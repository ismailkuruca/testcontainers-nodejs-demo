# Simple Integration Testing of an Express/Knex/Objection app via `testcontainers`

A very simple todo list app using postgres as the default DB engine and provides functionalities with Knex/Objection while serving them under an Express App.
Main takeaway is building a very simple integration test harness to test/validate the provided functionality where unit testing falls short.

## package.json

- `pg` - PostreSQL module
- `knex` - Query builder
- `objection` - ORM built upon Knex
- `express` - API framework
- `jest` & `supertest` - Simple testing scaffolding for the API
- `testcontainers` - Provides code driven container orchestration
